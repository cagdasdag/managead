You can easily add your ad codes to anywhere in your content.

== Description ==

For a long time, it was a problem for WordPress users to show their ad codes anywhere in the content.

It is of course possible to include the ad code as HTML, however this would require a certain amount of HTML knowledge. Beside this, it would mean loosing quite a lot of time.

Thanks to Gutenberg, you can find it as a block with the help of this plugin. Add your ad codes to your settings and change your ad codes by simply selecting the ad title anywhere in the content.  You can also change the ad code any time from your settings and the new changes will apply itself on the entire website!

Ps: This plugin works only with Gutenberg Editor (WordPress's blocks editor).
